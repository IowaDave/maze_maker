Code playground for making mazes

I keep files here for making mazes. It's just a place to keep the toys.

The .c files were written in October 2019. They produce html files with embedded SVG. The files must them be opened in a browser to draw the maze. Edit and recompile to change the maze dimensions in the next output file.

The .html files were adapted in January 2021 from the .c files. They contain javascript. Open and run the script directly in the browser. The javascript creates a new maze and writes the resulting SVG into the "innerHTML" attribute of a <div> element on. Drawing a new maze is as simple as clicking on the previous one.
  
  The .ts file was completed in late January 2021. It is designed to run on a BBC micro:bit. The code is written in Static TypeScript for the MakeCode editor.
